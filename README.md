SDEV 245 Week 1 Module 1 Assignment - RBAC and Authentication Mini-App

INSTRUCTIONS
Build a very basic app or script in any language (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java) that demonstrates the core ideas of authentication, roles, and access control.

Requirements:
Login simulation
- Use a hardcoded username and role in the script.
- No need for password hashing or form input.

User roles
- Create two user roles (e.g., admin and user) using simple logic or a dictionary.

Protected actions or routes
- Simulate two different functions or endpoints.
- Allow only admin to access one, and only user to access the other.

Code comment or short paragraph
- Explain in a few lines how your app shows one part of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability).

* * * 
Although the simplicity requirement of the assignment causes these two functions to not accomplish much,
It does illustrate the concept of triggering specific functions or actions depending on the credentials entered by the user.
